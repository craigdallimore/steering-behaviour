## Todo

- [ ] Typescript migration

  - [ ] Get canvas working
  - [ ] Get whole app working
  - [ ] yarn lint succeeds

- [ ] Decouple look-where-you-are-going from some behaviours
- [ ] Investigate and handle incorrectness issue with radiansToVector / vice versa

Steering pipeline

- Targeters
  - Work out what the movement goal is
  - targets could be positional, orientation, velocity, rotation (known as channels)
  - generate the top level goal
  - think in terms of the characters goal
- Decomposers
  - provide subgoals that lead to the main goal
  - might use a pathfinding algorithm to produce a route to a goal
  - most commonly used to integrate path planning into steering
  - can be any number
  - order matters
  - can do nothing (given the goal cannot be decomposed)
  - returns a subgoal, which is passed to the next decomposer, and so on until all decomposers are used
- constraints
  - limit that way a character can achieve a goal or sub-goal
  - detects if moving towards the current sub-goal violates the constraint and suggests avoidance
  - tends to represent obstacles (characters or walls)
  - used with the actuator; reviews paths and check if they are sensible
- actuator
  - only one per character
  - works out the path to the current subgoal
  - limits the physical movement capabilities of a character

## Vector directions

`[20, 0]` To East
`[-20, 0]` To West
`[0, -20]` To North
`[0, 20]` To South

## Orientations

Positive increments are clockwise
Negative increments are anticlockwise
