# TODO

## Bugs

- [ ] Reset button on scenario picker should not be present until the scenario has been started
- [ ] COLLISION_AVOIDANCE Not really working well?
- [ ] WANDER

## Test debt

- [ ] lib
- [ ] components
- [ ] steering
- [ ] reducer

## Features

- [ ] Make sure targets/paths/shapes can be picked for all behaviours
  - [ ] FOLLOW_PATH_CHASE_RABBIT
  - [ ] FOLLOW_PATH_PREDICT
  - [ ] OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE
- [ ] Behaviour config should include configuring dependent behaviour
- [ ] A character should be able to have multiple blendable behaviours
- [ ] Move helpers out from class files
- [ ] Reducer can be more imperative
- [ ] Find a way to have a debug variant for each view
- [ ] Scenario picker. It would be neat to select a scenario to play, and have the app restart with fresh state.
- [ ] Make it possible to dynamically add characters to a scenario
- [ ] Make it possible to draw paths
- [ ] Path should be closable?
- [ ] Should be possible to make the mouse a target
- [ ] The orientation picker should be more like a dial
- [ ] Help new users understand what they are looking at!
- [ ] Hovering an id should highlight the character
- [ ] The kinematic controls could be hidden until revealed
- [ ] Gather descriptions of each behaviour
- [ ] Add a button to stop a kinematic from moving
- [ ] Does dispatch cause unexpected re-renders?
- [ ] Do state changes cause unexpected re-renders?

## Maybe

- [ ] Characters should not be able to leave the canvas. Bounce off the sides maybe?
- [ ] Add Art Deco styling

## Steering pipeline

- Targeters
  - Work out what the movement goal is
  - targets could be positional, orientation, velocity, rotation (known as channels)
  - generate the top level goal
  - think in terms of the characters goal
- Decomposers
  - provide subgoals that lead to the main goal
  - might use a pathfinding algorithm to produce a route to a goal
  - most commonly used to integrate path planning into steering
  - can be any number
  - order matters
  - can do nothing (given the goal cannot be decomposed)
  - returns a subgoal, which is passed to the next decomposer, and so on until all decomposers are used
- constraints
  - limit that way a character can achieve a goal or sub-goal
  - detects if moving towards the current sub-goal violates the constraint and suggests avoidance
  - tends to represent obstacles (characters or walls)
  - used with the actuator; reviews paths and check if they are sensible
- actuator
  - only one per character
  - works out the path to the current subgoal
  - limits the physical movement capabilities of a character
